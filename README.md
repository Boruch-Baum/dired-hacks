# dired-hacks

Collection of useful dired additions.  I don't want this become another `dired+`, so I'm splitting all the functionality into separate mutually independent packages.  All shared functionality and helpers will be extracted into a single package `dired-hacks-utils`, so that will be the only dependence.

# dired-hacks-utils

Set of utility functions used in all the `dired-hacks` packages.

# dired-filter

Adds ibuffer-like filtering to dired.

# dired-avfs

Adds avfs support for seamless archive browsing.
